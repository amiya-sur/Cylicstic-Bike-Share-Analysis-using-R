Analysis has been developed by Amiya Sur. Please refer to the [Google Data
Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) for the complete documentaion of the
said problem.  

## Scenario :
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a
bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s
future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual
members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 
But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must
be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations  

### *For the time being we already have pre-defined question for the above problem which are as follows:*
1. *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*
2. *Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?*
3. *How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?*

Although,Lily Moreno director of marketing and my manager at the same time has asked
me to focus mainly on the **Question 1 - How do annual members and casual riders use
Cyclistic bikes differently?**

## Guiding Question
• What is the problem you are trying to solve?
The main objective of this problem is to identity the differences between
causal and Annual members usage pattern and to recommend marketing
strategies for turning maximum casual riders to annual members.  

• How many your insights drive business decisions?
The insights will help the marketing team to increase annual members and
maximize company revenue
